**Question 1:** The text describes an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) as a "recipe" or "blueprint" for your server. If you launch an EC2 instance from a specific AMI and subsequently install a new software package or modify a configuration file on that running instance, **does that change the original AMI?**

Explain why or why not, and describe the relationship between the AMI and the active instance in this specific scenario.

---

**Question 2:** Let's stick with the "Lifecycle" concept.

You have an EC2 instance that is currently **Stopped**. You also have an EC2 instance that has been **Terminated**.

From a billing and data persistence perspective, **what is the specific difference between these two states?** (Think about what you are paying for and what happens to the data on the attached EBS volumes in each scenario).

---

**Question 3:** Let's move to **Security Groups**.

Imagine you have deployed a Web Server on an EC2 instance. In the Security Group, you have added an **Inbound Rule** to allow traffic on **Port 80 (HTTP)** from anywhere (`0.0.0.0/0`) so users can load your website.

When the server processes the user's request and sends the webpage data back to the user, **do you need to add a specific Outbound Rule to allow that response traffic to leave the instance?**

---

**Question 4:** Now, let's look at **User Data** vs. **AMIs** from a performance perspective. This is a classic "Software Architect" trade-off.

You are architecting a solution for a flash-sale website. When traffic spikes, Auto Scaling will launch new EC2 instances, and they need to be ready to serve traffic in **under 2 minutes**.

Currently, you are using a generic Linux AMI and a **User Data script** that:

1. Updates the OS (`yum update`).
2. Downloads your application code.
3. Installs dependencies (Python, libraries).
4. Configures the database connection.

This script takes **15 minutes** to finish running after the instance boots.

**As an Architect, how would you change your strategy to meet the 2-minute requirement?** Explain what you would do and one downside (trade-off) of your new approach.
