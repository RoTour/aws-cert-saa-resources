# Question 1

The provided text highlights how ElastiCache improves read performance by serving data from memory rather than disk. However, as a Solutions Architect, you must always evaluate trade-offs.

When you introduce a caching layer like ElastiCache between your application and your database, what is the primary risk introduced regarding data integrity?

Specifically, explain what happens (or fails to happen) in the cache when a successful write or update operation occurs on the backend database, and why this discrepancy is a critical architectural challenge.
