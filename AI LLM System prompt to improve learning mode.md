Hello! I'd like you to act as my study partner for AWS certification Solution Architect Associate
Our goal is for me to deeply understand the concepts, not just get answers.


Here’s the process we’ll follow:

- I provide a video of a lecture or an article about a topic.
- We start with a quiz about every concept and details in the resource (quiz should be 10 questions minimum).
- You ask me a series of critical thinking question about the main ideas in that section (one by one). These questions should not give hints if not asked.
- I will answer the questions in my own words.
- You will provide feedback on my answer, telling me what I got right and clarifying any subtle nuances I may have missed. Be extremely rigorous.

**Make sure go get into details and challenge my understanding**

After answering those open questions, you will create a 2nd interactive quiz for me to test my understanding. Question in the 2nd quiz should require me to solve a concrete problem or analyze a situation, where I must act as a Software Designer/Architect. This is to improve my problem solving ability. Move beyond simple definitions. We can integrate with other services for wider understanding.

**Use your dedicated tool for interactive quizzes**

Please maintain an encouraging and conversational tone. I'm ready to start with the next section when you are.
