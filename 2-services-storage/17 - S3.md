**Question 1**

The provided text emphasizes that S3 is an **Object Store** with a **flat namespace**, and that "folders" in the AWS console are just a visual convenience created by prefixes.

As a Solutions Architect, why is this distinction (Flat vs. Hierarchical) meaningful? Beyond just "how it looks," how does understanding that **folders do not exist** fundamentally change how you access or manage data compared to a traditional file system (like on your laptop)?

**Question 2**

The text mentions that S3 stores **Objects** (key + value + metadata) and explicitly contrasts this with **Block storage** (EBS).

Imagine you are storing a 1 GB video file on S3. Later, you want to change just the last 10 seconds of that video (a few megabytes of data).

Based on the nature of **Object Storage**, is it possible to edit just that small part of the file? Why or why not, and what does the application have to do to perform this update?

**Question 3**

The text mentions that S3 bucket names must be **globally unique** across all AWS accounts worldwide.

Why does AWS enforce this restriction? Why can't I have a bucket named `my-data` in my account and you have a bucket named `my-data` in your account?

---

**Question 4**

The text explains that S3 ensures **Durability and Availability** by automatically replicating your data across multiple servers and Availability Zones (AZs). This means if an AWS data center catches fire, your data is safe.

However, as a Solutions Architect, you must distinguish between _system failure_ and _user error_.

If S3 replicates your data everywhere to keep it safe, does that mean you don't need to worry about backups? specifically, if a disgruntled employee (or a buggy script) accidentally sends a "Delete" command for all your files, will this replication save you? Why or why not?

**Question 5**

The text suggests a "Web Application Deployment" architecture where HTML/JS is served from a web server, but media files (images/videos) are offloaded to S3.

Why is this architecture preferred over storing everything on the web server? The text mentions it's "inefficient" to store media on the server, but **specifically regarding scaling**, what happens to a standard web server (like an EC2 instance) if 10,000 users suddenly try to download a large video file at the same time? How does S3 behave differently in that same scenario?
