### Question 1

The text highlights that Amplify "automates the configuration" of services like DynamoDB and Cognito to speed up development. This is often called an "opinionated" approach—Amplify has a preferred way of setting things up.

**Scenario:** You are a Solution Architect for a financial institution. You have strict internal compliance rules that require very specific, non-standard configurations for database encryption keys and IAM permission boundaries.

**Why might Amplify's "automated configuration" be a significant disadvantage in this specific high-compliance environment?** What control are you potentially sacrificing for that speed?

### Question 2

Amplify Studio allows you to create UI components (like a login form) visually and bind them to data. This sounds great for a prototype.

**Imagine your application scales to millions of users and your design team completely rebrands the company with complex, custom animations and non-standard user flows (e.g., a multi-step biometric login).**

**What problems will you likely encounter with those "Pre-built UI Components" generated by Amplify Studio?**

### Question 3

Let's talk about **"Lock-in."** If you build your entire application using Amplify (frontend libraries, CLI for deployment, Amplify Studio for management), and then one day you decide you want to move your backend to **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** or **Microsoft Azure**.

**How difficult would this migration be compared to an application built with generic, open-source tools (like standard Terraform and a generic React app)? Explain why.**
