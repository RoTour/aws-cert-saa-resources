**Question 1:**

The text states that **Direct Connect** "bypasses the public internet," whereas a **Site-to-Site VPN** builds an encrypted tunnel _over_ the public internet.

Imagine you are an Architect for a media company. You need to transfer massive raw video files (terabytes of data) from your on-premises studio to Amazon S3 every night. You have the budget for either solution.

Even if you configured enough VPN tunnels (using ECMP) to match the **bandwidth** of a Direct Connect link, why would **Direct Connect** still be the superior choice for this specific "big data" use case?
