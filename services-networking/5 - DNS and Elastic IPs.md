**Question:** Imagine you are the Architect for a high-traffic web application. You expect traffic spikes that will trigger an **Auto Scaling Group** to launch 50 new EC2 instances to handle the load.

**Would you design a system that assigns an Elastic IP to every single one of these 50 new instances?**
- **Why or why not?**
- If you don't use Elastic IPs for them, how will your customers on the internet find and connect to these 50 instances if their IP addresses are constantly changing?
