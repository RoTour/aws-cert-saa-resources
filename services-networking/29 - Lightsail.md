**Critical Thinking Question 1:**

The text states that Lightsail "automatically handles the underlying VPC configuration... behind the scenes."

As a Solutions Architect, you know that AWS Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) are normally private, isolated networks where you explicitly define subnets, Route Tables, and Internet Gateways.

If you have a strict compliance requirement that says **"No database shall ever be reachable from the public internet,"** and you launch a Lightsail instance with a WordPress blueprint (which includes a database), can you guarantee this compliance as easily as you could with a custom EC2 setup?

**Does the simplicity of Lightsail compromise your ability to implement complex network security architectures? Why or why not?**
