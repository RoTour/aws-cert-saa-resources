**Question 1:** You have an application where users can download sensitive legal documents stored in S3. A developer suggests using a single Pre-signed URL with a 7-day expiration and posting it on a password-protected internal wiki for the legal team to use.

From a Security Architect's perspective, what is the primary risk of this approach, and what specific change to the URL generation process would you recommend to mitigate that risk while still using Pre-signed URLs?

**Question 2:** Let's look at the **Upload** side of things.

You are designing a system where users upload large 2GB video files. You decide to use Pre-signed URLs to allow direct uploads to S3, bypassing your EC2-based API.

However, your security team is worried. They ask: _"If we give the user a Pre-signed URL to upload `video1.mp4`, what stops that user from using that same URL to overwrite a different, existing file like `company_logo.png` or `critical_data.csv` in the same bucket?"_

Based on how Pre-signed URLs are constructed, how do you answer the security team? (Be specific about what the URL is tied to).

**Question 3 (The "Identity" Challenge):**

You are using an **IAM Role** assigned to an EC2 instance to generate these pre-signed URLs.

The security team notices that the URLs generated by this role are expiring much sooner than the 7-day maximum you initially expected (they are failing after just a few hours).

Why is the 7-day limit not applying here, and what is the "source of truth" for the maximum lifetime of a URL generated by an IAM Role (STS) versus a standard IAM User?
